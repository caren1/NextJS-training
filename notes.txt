What is NextJS?

Is a React frontend development web framework created by Vercel, that enables functionality as server-side
rendering and static site generation. It builds on top of React giving additional features.
+ Framework for creating pre-rendered React websites
+ Offers us both Server Side Rendering and Static site Generation
SSR -> When React components are getting rendered into HTML of the webpage after the request comes to the browser
SSG -> When React components are getting rendered into HTML of the webpage at the build time 

Server Side Rendering 
Unlike a traditional React app where the entire application is loaded and renderted on the client, NextJS
allows the first page to load to be rendered by server, which is great for SEO and performance.

Other benefits:
- Better SEO
- Pre-rendering improves performance
- Easy page routing
- Api Routes
- Out of the box TypeScript and Sass
- Static site generation (next export)
- Easy deployment


///////////////////////////////////////

- lower case for pages, uppercase for components
- possibility of adding styles in JS
    -> <style jsx>{`.title{color: ${x>3 ? 'red':'blue'}}`}</style>
- custom document
- there are 3 static methods to get the data within pages: 
getStaticProps - fetching data at build time
getServerSideProps - fetching on every request
getStaticPaths - dynamically rendering paths based on the data we are fetching

1 -- easiest way to create nextjs app is by using npx create-next-app
2 -- every page is driven by react component, placed in the 'pages' directory = routes *not for index.js = '/'
if we have index.js within some directories it will create root path for that file
