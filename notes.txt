What is NextJS?

Is a React frontend development web framework created by Vercel, that enables functionality as server-side
rendering and static site generation. It builds on top of React giving additional features.

Server Side Rendering 
Unlike a traditional React app where the entire application is loaded and renderted on the client, NextJS
allows the first page to load to be rendered by server, which is great for SEO and performance.

Other benefits:
- Easy page routing
- Api Routes
- Out of the box TypeScript and Sass
- Static site generation (next export)
- Easy deployment
